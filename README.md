  <h1>ABOUT PYTHON</h1>

  <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It’s used everywhere – from web apps and automation tools to data science and artificial intelligence. Whether you’re streaming a show, booking a flight, or chatting with an AI, Python is likely working behind the scenes.</p>

  <h2>HISTORY OF PYTHON</h2>
  <p>Python’s story begins with a single programmer. Guido van Rossum designed the language and released it on February 20, 1991, aiming to create a system that felt clear, approachable, and even enjoyable to write. Unlike many programming languages that originate inside large corporations, Python grew out of one person’s attempt to simplify the act of coding.

The name is a cultural joke rather than a biological reference. It comes from the BBC comedy series Monty Python’s Flying Circus, reflecting the playful spirit Guido wanted the language to carry.

What started as an individual project quickly attracted a global following. Developers, educators, and scientists expanded Python’s capabilities, pushing it into areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and modern education. Its growth has been guided not by a single company, but by a collaborative community.

Today, stewardship of the language rests with the Python Software Foundation, a nonprofit organization that protects and supports Python’s development while nurturing the worldwide network of contributors who keep it evolving.</p>

  <h2>USES IN ECONOMICS</h2>
  <p>Python’s role in economics grew alongside a transformation in how economists work. For much of the 20th century, research depended on rigid statistical software and languages like Fortran. As datasets expanded and models became more computational, economists needed tools that were flexible and readable. Python filled that need.

In the early 2000s, scientific libraries such as NumPy and SciPy made Python suitable for heavy numerical work like matrix algebra, optimization, and simulations, all central to economic modeling. This helped researchers write complex models in a clear, accessible style, which encouraged experimentation and collaboration.

Python also lowered barriers to entry. Because it is free and open source, students and researchers worldwide gained access to the same analytical tools. This supported the growth of reproducible research, where economists can share code alongside their findings so others can verify and extend their work.

As economic data expanded in scale, from financial markets to social and policy datasets, Python became a practical environment for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing information in one workflow. Today it sits at the intersection of economics and data science, powering forecasting, experiments, and policy analysis. In that sense, Python not only assists economics but also reshapes how economic knowledge is produced and shared.
